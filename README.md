# Graph Data Structure with TDD, BDD, and CI/CD Visualization: The Final Chapter

## Project Overview

This project represents the conclusion of an exploratory series into Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Python data structures, focusing on the implementation of a Graph Data Structure. Building upon the foundational knowledge established in my previous projects on [Queue](https://github.com/Chiuzu-Chilumbu/Build_Queue_With_TDD) and [Stack](https://github.com/Chiuzu-Chilumbu/Build_Stack_With_TDD), this final project aims to deepen the understanding of graph theory and its practical applications. Through TDD and BDD methodologies, this endeavour not only challenges but also enhances problem-solving skills with complex data structures, emphasizing graph traversals such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS), among others. A standout feature is the CI/CD pipeline integration for automated testing and deployment, and the innovative addition of graph visualizations to verify the structure and operations of graphs dynamically and intuitively.

## Development Approach

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- **Unit Testing**: Began with writing unit tests for fundamental graph operations, including node insertion, edge creation, and property checks (e.g., acyclic properties for trees).
- **Traversal Algorithms**: Developed tests for traversal algorithms ensuring coverage for various graph types, including directed, undirected, weighted, and unweighted graphs.

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

- Utilized `pytest-bdd` to define feature files for user-centric behaviours, including finding shortest paths, detecting cycles, and conducting connectivity checks between nodes. These feature files translate complex graph behaviours into readable scenarios for non-technical readers.

## CI/CD Pipeline with Visualization

- **Continuous Integration**: Set up GitHub Actions to automate testing for every commit, ensuring all graph operations and traversals work as expected.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automated deployment of graph visualizations to GitHub Pages, showcasing the dynamic construction and traversal of graphs as code changes.
- **Visualization Tool Integration**: Incorporated tools like Graphviz for generating visual representations of graphs, seamlessly integrated within the CI/CD pipeline for real-time feedback on graph structures and algorithm behaviours.

## Real-World Applications

Graph data structures are instrumental in numerous fields such as computer networks, social network analysis, geographic information systems (GIS), and more. By understanding and manipulating graphs, we can solve complex problems like routing algorithms, recommendation systems, and network connectivity.

## Conclusion

This Graph Data Structure project marks not just the conclusion of a series but a testament to the power of systematic testing and development practices in software engineering. It embodies how foundational concepts in computer science can be explored, understood, and mastered through deliberate practice and continuous integration and delivery. As the final chapter in this series, it paves the way for future explorations into the vast sea of data structures and algorithms, always with an eye towards quality, reliability, and the never-ending pursuit of knowledge.
